Lab.
                                                                                **
  1. On running /usr/bin/ls with the options -a, -A and both -a -A, I found that
     the 'bug' still exists. The -A option DOES NOT override a previous -a
     option.

  2. By running the man command on /usr/bin/ls, I found that the ls version
     installed at usr/bin/ls corresponds to GNU coreutils 8.22 .

  3. I downloaded the Coreutils 8.29 source tarball using the wget command and
     obtained the coreutils-8.29.tar.xz file
     Using the wget command I downloaded the signature file for coreutils
     and also the gnu-keyring

  4. Using the gpg command, I attempted to verify the signature. The command says
     that the signature is good. However it also says that there is no indication
     that this particular key belongs to the owner (user).

  5. I then ran the ./configure file with the --prefix flag to a new directory
     in the home directory. Then I ran the make command to compile, and then the
     make install command to install the coreutils package. I didnt run into any
     issues with this command

  6. On running the version of ls that has just been installed, I was able to
     reproduce the bug. On running ls -a -A, the . and .. would still be
     displayed.
