1. Maintaining log...

2. Cloned repo and updated

       cp -r ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils .
       git pull

   Checkedout a new branch of v3.0 called quote

       git checkout -b quote v3.0

3. patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

   Output:
       patching file src/cmp.c
       patching file src/diff.c
       patching file src/diff3.c
       patching file src/dir.c
       patching file src/sdiff.c
       patching file src/util.c

4.
5. Opened emacs
   C-x 4 a

   Copied the changelog entry from the original quote patch generated.
   Removed the changes that were revoked and kept the ones needed

6. Commit changes

      git commit -aF ChangeLog

7. Generate formatted patch

      git format-patch -1 --stdout > ../formatted-patch.txt

8. Partner Name:
      Maksym Prokopovych-Shchepetkin

   I renamed the patch to maksym-formatted-patch.txt to avoid confusing it with my own

   I then checkedout a new branch from v3.0 called partner

      git checkout -b partner v3.0

   To apply the patch I used:

      git am ../maksym-formatted-patch.txt

   To build this version I followed the same steps as the lab:
      switch to server 02
      ./bootstrap
      ./configure
      make
      make check

   I ran the diff executable produced
   src/diff . -
   and
   src/diff --help

   The commands output no ` character and so the patch was a success


9. I went back to my patched version of diffutils and ran

     make distdir

   This produced a new directory with the name

     diffutils-3.0.1-f4a6
   
   This directory had a ChangeLog file whose first entry was:

   2019-06-04  Dhruv Sharma  <dhruvsharma0503@gmail.com>

	2019-06-04  Dhruv Sharma  <dhruvs@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu>
		This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
		which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
		`like this' or ``like this''.
		* src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
		* src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value)
		(compare_files):
		* src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage)
		(read_diff):
		* src/dir.c (compare_names):
		* src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):
		* src/util.c (finish_output):
		Quote 'like this' in output.

   Therefore the patch was successfull by all means.

10. Ran gitk on the ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs repo and scanned the logs to find stuff from around 2015-01-25

    There is a mergepoint on that very day
